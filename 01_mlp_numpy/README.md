# MLP from Scratch (NumPy)
This implements a (slightly overengineered) 3-layer MLP from scratch using only NumPy

## Features
- Forward/backward pass manually implemented
- Cross-entropy loss and accuracy metric
- some simple Logging and plotting utilities
- multi-class classification


# TODOS
- [] batch training
- [] Implement some optimizers
